# My Terminal & Development Setup

This is my personal setup for working efficiently in the terminal and optimizing my development workflow.
It includes configurations for Zsh, Tmux and Neovim (LazyVim).

This is a work in progress! I'll be updating it as I learn more about Neovim and discover new tools and configurations that enhance my workflow.
